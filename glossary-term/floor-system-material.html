<p>The material is that from which the floor is primarily constructed. Do not include materials that are non-structural or that are not part of the structure of the floor. In many cases floor structures can be overlaid with timber flooring or tiles etc., but it is the structure under that overlay material that should be listed as the material of the floor.</p>
