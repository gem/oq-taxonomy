<p>An L-, U-, E- or other (in plan) shaped building where two wings may oscillate out-of-phase, leading to large shear stresses in floor and/or roof diaphragms.<br /><br />If the plan setback is at least 15% of both plan dimensions, then the setback is considered to form a re-entrant corner.</p>

<p>This diagram illustrates the principle that a 15% plan setback is required in both directions for it to be considered a re-entrant corner.</p>

<p>Movement of the  wings of an L-shaped building during an earthquake results in high shear stresses combined with a  stress concentration at the re-entrant corner; this is aggravated by torsional effects which develop since the center of mass and the center of rigidity cannot coincide in this form. (FEMA 454)</p>

<p>West Anchorage High School suffered extensive damage in the 1964 Alaska earthquake. Stress concentration at re-entrant corner caused damage in the concrete roof diaphragm of this reinforced concrete building.
