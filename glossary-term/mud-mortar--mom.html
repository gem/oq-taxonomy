<p><span>Soil  is mixed with water and used as <a class="internal-link" href="term/mortar">mortar</a> for various types of masonry construction. It is characterized by earthen colour, and it can be easily scratched (removed) from the wall using a sharp object (like a key).This type of mortar can be found mostly in adobe construction (e.g. Latin America and  Asia), and stone masonry housing construction in remote rural areas where cement and/or lime are either unavailable or too expensive (e.g. south-east Asia). Mud mortar is a low-strength mortar, and it is the weakest of all mortar types. </span></p>
