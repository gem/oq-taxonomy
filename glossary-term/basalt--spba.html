<p>Basalt is a dark-colored, fine-grained, igneous volcanic rock which is hard and dense. Individual mineral crystals are typically hard to see with the naked eye, although some kinds can contain larger crystals, or it may have holes that are empty (bubbles) or filled with other minerals.  Basalts are generally black or dark grey and polish well.  As a result, they are not easily scratched by metal objects. Basalt is often used for paving and ocasionally for wall construction.</p>
