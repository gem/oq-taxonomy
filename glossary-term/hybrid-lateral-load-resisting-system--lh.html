<p>Hybrid Lateral Load-Resisting System (LLRS) exists in one of the following two cases: a) there is more than one LLRS in the building, but there is no clear distinction between LLRSs in two principal directions (X and Y), or b) there is only one LLRS in the building, but two or more materials of the LLRS are used in different portions of the building. Note that <a class="internal-link" href="term/dual-frame-wall-system--ldual">Dual Frame-Wall System</a> is also a hybrid system, however it has been classified as a separate LLRS in the taxonomy. It should be also noted that <a class="internal-link" href="term/direction">Direction</a> attribute is intended to be used to describe buildings with two distinct LLRSs in principal directions of the building, which are also hybrid systems.</p>
<p>Different LLRSs could exist up the building height, or there could be more than one system in each principal direction of the building. For example, reinforced concrete moment frame exists in bottom one or two storeys and load-bearing masonry in the upper storeys in the same building.</p>
<p>An example of a hybrid LLRS where two different materials are used is Wall system, where load-bearing masonry exists in bottom one or two storeys supporting a wooden lateral load-resisting system (also classified as Wall) above.</p>

<p>An example of a hybrid system from Chile, where reinforced concrete columns exist in longitudinal direction (baylines 1 and 3) at the lower two floor levels, and there are reinforced masonry walls at upper levels (as shown on the floor plan above). Reinforced concrete walls along bayline 2 exist at the ground floor level, and there are reinforced masonry walls at upper levels. Walls in transverse direction (baylines A and C) are of reinforced masonry at all floor levels. Walls along bayline B are of reinforced concrete construction at the ground floor level, and reinforced masonry construction at upper levels (M.O. Moroni Yadlin).</p>

<p><span>An old loadbearing brick masonry building at the ground  floor has been overlaid by new reinforced concrete frame construction  above; the damage to the masonry part occurred during the Athens  earthquake of Sept. 7, 1999; reinforced concrete frame extensions (in  plan, or elevation, or both) to old masonry buildings are frequent in  Greece </span><span>where they constitute around 5% of the existing building stock</span><span>” (A. Pomonis)</span></p>

<p>C<span>ollapse of the 6th storey of the 8-storey Kobe City Hall Annex building in the 1995 Kobe, Japan earthquake. The collapse was likely due to a hybrid lateral load-resisting system consisting of steel reinforced concrete (SRC) at lower floors and RC frame at upper floors (C. Scawthorn). <br /></span></p>
