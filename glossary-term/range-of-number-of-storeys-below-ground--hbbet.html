<p>Recording the number of storeys below ground as a range can be used where there is a lack of certainty about the exact number of storeys below ground but the surveyor is able to determine a range. This does not include the ground floor. It includes storage and mechanical plant levels only if these cover over 50% of the plan area.<br /><br />HBBET:a,b <br />where a=upper bound and b= lower bound for the range <br />Example: HBET:2,1 Â <br />(between 1 and 2 levels of basement)</p>
