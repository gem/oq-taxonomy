<p><a name="taxonomyTag:floor-connections"></a></p>
<p>Classifies floor connections that transfer in-plane forces of floor diaphragms to the lateral load-resisting structure of the building (e.g. walls), and also restrain outward displacements of walls. These connections apply to suspended floor diaphragms only, they do not apply to floors at ground floor level.</p>
