<p>This attribute defines the following two aspects of connections from the roof to the structure of the building:<br /><br />(a) Connections that enable the roof diaphragm to transfer horizontal shear forces induced by an earthquake or wind to the lateral load-resisting structure of the building and to prevent walls from falling away from the diaphragm.<br /><br />(b) Connections from the roof to the vertical structure of the building to prevent wind uplift or lift-off.</p>
