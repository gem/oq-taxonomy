<p>The material that covers the roof. In most cases this is different to the material of the roof system, but in some cases the roof covering will be the same as the roof system. In both cases, both the roof covering and the roof system should be defined where they are known. Where there are multiple covering materials present on the roof(s), choose the covering that covers more of the roof(s) by area than any other covering material.</p>
