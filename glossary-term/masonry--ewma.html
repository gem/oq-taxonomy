<p>All types of masonry units used as cladding, infill, or exposed wall structure. Includes a variety of masonry units, including adobe bricks and blocks, burnt clay bricks and blocks, stone, ceramic tile. It is often difficult to identify type of masonry units once the walls have been covered by plaster. These walls can be in the form of veneers, cavity walls, infill walls, as well as all of these materials used as <a class="internal-link" href="term/wall--lwal">Wall</a> structure (a part of the Lateral Load-Resisting System), and where they are not covered by another material.</p>

<p>An exterior masonry wall may be a part of the cavity wall system, which consists of two masonry walls separated by an air gap; usually, one wall is load-bearing while the other is veneer (cladding). These walls may be connected by metal ties, and horizontal reinforcement may be provided (A. Charleson)</p>

<p>Masonry veneers are common exterior walls in Canada and the USA; a masonry veneer is a single-wythe brick masonry wall securely fastened to a structural backing (e.g. <a class="external-link" href="term/http://www.masonrybc.org/wall_details/concrete-support-block-1-1.htm">concrete masonry block wall</a>, <a class="external-link" href="term/http://www.masonrybc.org/wall_details/concrete-support-steel-1-1.htm">steel</a> or <a class="external-link" href="term/http://www.masonrybc.org/wall_details/concrete-support-wood-1-1.htm">wood</a> stud framing). A veneer can be attached to structural backing by means of metal ties (B. McEwen, Canada; hyperlinked drawings courtesy of Masonry Institute of BC)</p>

<p>The exterior walls shown on the top photos look like loadbearing brick masonry construction. The photo on the left shows an older loadbearing brick masonry wall (built between 1900 and 1950), while the photo on the right shows a wall in a modern building (built between 1990 and 2010) which has similar masonry detailing like older buildings. However, the exterior brick masonry wall is a veneer and the loadbearing wall is likely a wood frame. The wall has weep holes characteristic of veneer construction (see detail on the bottom photo). The photos were taken in Vancouver, Canada (B. McEwen)</p>
