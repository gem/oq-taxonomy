<p>Wooden beams or trusses and joists, supporting heavy roof covering. Examples include a sloped wooden roof with a layer of earth covered by clay roof tiles, found in high precipitation regions around the world. Another example of heavy covering is stone tiles, which are used for roofing.</p>
<p>This also includes flat roofs with heavy roof covering made from mixture of clay, straw and tamped earth. New layers are added annually to the roof as a protection against rain and snow percolation. These roofs are predominantly found in single-storey buildings in rural areas of Eastern Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, China, as well as in the Andean highlands and other regions.</p>
