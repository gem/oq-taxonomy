<p>An approximate number of storeys above ground can be determined by the surveyor where the exact number of storeys above ground is not clear from survey or drawing. The number of the floors above ground includes the ground floor and floors above. It also includes storage and mechanical plant levels only if these cover over 50% of the plan area, but does not include basements below ground. If the building is stepped in height, then record the highest part.</p>
<p><br />HAPP:n <br />where n = approximate number of storeys above ground level (integer) <br />Example: HAPP:2 (approximately two-storey high building)</p>
