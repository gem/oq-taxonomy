<p><a name="taxonomyTag:date-of-construction-or-retrofit"></a></p>
<p>Date of construction can be taken from when the building was completed. If the building consists of structures that vary in age, use the earliest date. If the structure of the building has been upgraded (retrofitted) in a manner that improves its seismic performance, enter the date of the retrofit instead of the date of construction.</p>
